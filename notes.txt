To do:
- automatic aorta segmentation testing 
- options: MSAC background correction
- copy centerline segmentation to maps tab
- copy centerline flow locations to maps tab to view planes
- write more functions for readability
- fix diameter viewing (WSS) and calculation using centerline?
- slice by slice vectors? overlaid on magnitude?
- kinetic energy
- button for 'finished cropping' to crop all data in first 3D view
- shortcut buttons (arrow keys for slices/timeframes in velocity unwrapping)
