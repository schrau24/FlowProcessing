To do:
- automatic aorta segmentation 
- copy centerline flow locations to maps tab to view planes
- write more functions for readability
- fix diameter viewing (WSS) and calculation using centerline?
- save function to maps tab
- save graphics/memory visualization with pre-calculated and save variables?
- labelling on velocity unwrapping tab
- update PWV image output to match save animation
- TKE
- Dicom reading + saving
- interpolate to isotropic button?
- option to do further manual segmentation (with e.g. imtool3d)
